How should the data be stored/organized?
How should the data be used and organized during runtime?

How do the major data objects relate to one another and with the UI?

Comprehensive schedule gets ALL data from 'MAIN SCHEDULE' and all 'SUB ACCOUNTS' and their schedules.
'MAIN SCHEDULE' is just a list of scheduled transaction templates
This is also true for each 'SUB ACCOUNT'
so
COMPREHENSIVE = MAIN SCHEDULE forecasted
MAIN SCHEDULE = [schedules, total(SUB ACCOUNT 1), total(SUB ACCOUNT 2), total(SUB ACCOUNT 3)] 
SUB ACCOUNT 1 = [schedules]
SUB ACCOUNT 2 = [schedules]
SUB ACCOUNT 3 = [schedules]

SO

the main schedule and each sub account schedule should all be handled the same in construction and storage
the only exception is that main will have a single monthly payment for each sub account


schedules and accounts are saved as json files
transaction logs can be saved in sqlite DB
